**ℹ NOTE**
* The main purpose of this project is to **document, evaluate and benchmark** the strong qualities of the `Rust` language by building a real-world FullStack `TypeScript` (BE+FE) application from scratch then reimplementing everything in `Rust`. I'm opensourcing a project that I've made back in 2020 using current (as of October 2022) tech and best practices from scratch because I want it to be scientifically fair for both sides. It could take a while to reimplement everything so stay tuned (:star: **star this repo if you like it**) and follow me on this huge endeavor.
* `Rust` version of this repository: [endeavor-assistant](https://github.com/amindWalker/endeavor-assistant)
* The expected result from this:
    > - [x] `Rust` takes a "Data First" approach, making you take better decisions upfront while giving your IDE more information about your code (i.e. better integration with code completions) delivering incredible Developer Experience (DX) along the way.[^1]
    > - [x] There is **no inheritance** in `Rust` by default. This is another way to avoid complex structures which lead to hard-to-catch bugs in runtime. If you need inheritance you can mimic this behavior by implementing `Traits`.[^2]
    > - [x] `Rust` + `WebAssembly` provides faster, more secure, and predictable behavior (at compile-time) applications.[^3]
    > - [ ] Better maintainable codebase in the medium or long term.[^4]
    > - [ ] Front-end and back-end in `Rust` keep high-level abstractions with readable modern functional programming concepts comparable to or better than `TypeScript`.[^5]
    > - [x] Smaller cross-platform WASM bundles (binaries + dependencies).[^6]
    > - [x] Dramatic less memory and CPU usage (environment friendly while saving money and time).[^7]
    > - [x] First-class Tests, Documentation and Packaging (meaning less third-party dependencies and fragmentation) via Cargo and [crates.io](https://crates.io/).[^8]
    > - [x] Best-in-class compiler messages with inline manuals integrated with your IDE of choice.[^9]
